# Programming Assignment 3
## Description
You will create a simple website that has a pleasing appearance and incorporates commonly used features, such as lists, images, and tables.  Your website must also follow essential accessibility guidelines so that it can be navigated by a user employing a screen reader and maintain sufficient contrast between text and background so that it passes the WAVE accessibility checker (https://webaim.org/) without level one errors.


The content of your page is your choice, but it must be suitable for work.  You can use a Lorem Ipsum generator, include a draft of the text for your Final Project, or write something else.  If you use content from a source other than yourself, make sure that you include an acknowledgement or citation, giving credit to the content owner.

Task
Create two basic HTML pages using a plain text editor.  You may follow the instructions used in class to get started.  

You will need to have some content so that you can see how your page looks as you make the changes to appearances listed below.  Use a Lorem Ipsum generator or write something yourself.  You could also use part of a text that is in the public domain (i.e. no longer protected by copyright - see Project Gutenberg), but you should cite the source.

Divide the text on your pages into at least three sections, using headings. Remember to nest these appropriately.

Using either internal or external CSS, define styles for the elements on your pages:

Page background color

Paragraph text fonts (and possibly color)

Heading fonts (and possibly color)

Create at least three links:

One to an external site

One in each document that links to the other one (relative links - assume that the pages will be in the same directory)

Add these elements to your page:

A table

A list (ordered or unordered)

An image (you may use the orchid.jpeg file available in Moodle)


Requirements
In addition to completing the above tasks, your submission must meet the following requirements:

It contains at least two HTML pages, plus an optional CSS document

Most styling of elements must be done by CSS, although you may override it in an element tag for one or two elements.

Font color and page background color must have at least a 4.5 : 1 ratio, checked by https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

Each document must have sufficient content to fill a screen.

Links must work correctly

Include an acknowledgement/citation for text used (even if it is Lorem Ipsum) and any images used.  The orchid image in Moodle was taken by me (Barbara Z. Johnson).

The image must include alt text describing the image.
